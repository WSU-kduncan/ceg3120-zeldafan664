# Setup: 
## Dependencies:
 There are a few packages that need to be installed to run the project that you will need: 
	- Python 3 
	- Pip3
	- Discord.py
	- Discord Account
	- Your own discord server 
## API Token: 
	- To get an API Token for your bot, you first need to create an application for your bot in the Discord Developer Portal. 
	- To do that, head over to http://discordapp.com/developers/applications and sign in with you Discord Account.
	- There, you will select New Application. Choose a name and then click create.
	- On the list to the left of the screen, click on Bot, then on that screen click Add Bot
	- Once your bot is created, you can copy its Token and paste it into your .env file. 
	
#Usage: 
	- For my bot, I changed the messages and command. So, if you send the chat howdy!, the FloweyBot will respond with a random Flowey Quote from the game Undertale.
#Research: 
	- Since the bot relies on the host machines power or state to be active, the only solution to always keeping the bot running is to host it from the cloud in some way. There are a few bot hosting sites that I have found, such as pebblehost and BotGhost.
